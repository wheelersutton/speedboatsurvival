# Speed Boat Survival
CS 2261 Final Project

This was a project I made for my Media Device Architecture class.  It is written in C for a Game Boy Advance emulator.

To run the project, you must first download either the Boycott Advance (MAC) or Visual Boy Advance (Windows) emulator.

Boycott Advance:  http://www.bannister.org/software/ba.htm

Visual Boy Advance: https://www.emuparadise.me/Nintendo_Gameboy_Advance_Emulators/Windows/VisualBoyAdvance/86

Once downloaded and installed, find the file called speedboatsurvival.gba and double click to open.
